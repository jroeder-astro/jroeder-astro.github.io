For Everyone
------

I am an astrophysicist, with a theoretical background but stranded in observational astronomy. During my PhD, I will work on jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN), powered by supermassive black holes. Formerly, using theoretical models, I worked on testing Einstein's theory of genera relativity by comparing synthetic images of black holes.

Space has fascinated me since my early childhood (who does space not fascinate, after all). Over the course of school, my goal to study physics and astronomy manifested, and in 2021 I received my Master's degree from [Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de) in Germany. For my Master studies, I was part of [Prof. Dr. Luciano Rezzolla's](https://astro.uni-frankfurt.de/rezzolla/) research group, with [Alejandro Cruz-Osorio](https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~osorio/index.html) as my thesis advisor. Shortly after, I joined the working group of [Prof. Dr. Anton Zensus](https://antonzensus.de/) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, with [Prof. Dr. Eduardo Ros](https://www.uv.es/~eros/Ros_Homepage/Home.html) as my PhD supervisor.



For Nerds
------

I currently work in observational radio astronomy, with an otherwise purely theoretical background. My research focus so far has been the comparison of spacetimes under the aspect of various emission models, by means of black hole imaging. For my Master studies, I carried out general-relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations on general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of black holes. My work built upon the pioneering publication of Mizuno et al. 2018, who tried to assess the ability to test general relativity with black hole observations. Mizuno et al. 2018 compared a moderately rotating Kerr- to a non-rotating Dilaton black hole in a standard and normal evolution (SANE) model for the magnetic field. In my work, I extended that study with two GRMHD simulations in a magnetic field configuration aiming to reach a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state. In radiative post-processing, together with thermal emission I further included a kappa electron energy distribution function (eDF) to account for non-thermal emission in the jet.
